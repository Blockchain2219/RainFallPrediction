## Introduction
The rainfall prediction system aims to forecast rainfall patterns using historical weather data and an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. The system receives real-time rainfall data from a NodeMCU device through a serial connection, and the predictions are communicated through the WhatsApp API. This system provides alerts and notifications based on predefined rainfall thresholds or specific conditions.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/rainfall-prediction.git`.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
1. Preprocess and prepare the historical weather dataset.
2. Train the LSTM model using the prepared dataset.
3. Connect the NodeMCU device to the rain gauge or weather sensor.
4. Ensure the NodeMCU is connected to the machine running the rainfall prediction system via a serial connection.
5. Start the system by running `python main.py`.
6. Monitor the predictions and receive alerts or notifications through the WhatsApp API.

## Data Collection
To collect the historical weather data, reliable sources or meteorological organizations should be consulted. Gather data on features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and previous rainfall measurements. Preprocess the data by normalizing values and splitting it into training and testing sets.

## LSTM Model Training
The LSTM model is trained using a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Feed the preprocessed training data into the model to learn the temporal dependencies and patterns. Adjust the model architecture and hyperparameters based on evaluation metrics like MSE or RMSE.

## NodeMCU Data Acquisition
Connect the NodeMCU device to the rain gauge or weather sensor using appropriate interfaces. Ensure the NodeMCU is set up to communicate with the machine learning algorithm via a serial connection. Use PySerial to establish the communication link.

## WhatsApp Integration
Integrate the system with the WhatsApp API to receive rainfall data alerts and notifications. Implement message sending and receiving functionality using the WhatsApp Business API or third-party libraries like Twilio or Yowsup. Process rainfall data from the NodeMCU and send alerts or notifications when conditions are met.

## Deployment and Monitoring
Deploy the trained LSTM model and the integrated WhatsApp functionality on a server or cloud platform for continuous monitoring. Ensure the system periodically collects rainfall data from the NodeMCU, feeds it into the LSTM model, and generates predictions. Monitor the system's accuracy and performance, making adjustments as necessary.
